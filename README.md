# behavioralSequences
This repository contains my code to take a LabGym behavior output file in .xlsx format and find behavioral sequences. You can view and filter the resulting sequences within the app and then save them to an Excel file.  

Here is a quick video that I made showing how to install the app and its basic operations:

This is app uses Python, WxPython, and Pandas.

(this readme is a work in progress; I'll update it once I'm done with finals)
